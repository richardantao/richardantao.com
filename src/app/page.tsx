				<p>
					A self-taught software developer (more of a <em>&ldquo;hacker&rdquo;</em> than an engineer), interested in exploring
					better methods and tools for learning and productivity, particularly within the domain of formal education.

					In my free time, I enjoy reading, strength-training, and endurance running.
